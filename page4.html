 SOLVE All of the Following PROBLEMs
(Every Text-Sequence that Refers to a Problem is found in-between two instances of this star-symbol "*"). 

(Every Text-Line that contains a Text-Sequence that Refers to a Problem will start with a Number at the beginning of the Text-Line written in the following way "(1.) ". This Number Represents the Relative Importance of the Problem compared to all the other Problems. The Closer that a Problem is to the Number 1, the More Important it is to Solve that Problem). 


(1.)  *DYSTOPIA → DYSTOPIAN SITUATIONs and DYSTOPIAN RISKs*

DYSTOPIA is a SITUATION where there is Above Zero Presence of Any of the Following Phenomena →  

Violence, MindHarm, Evil, Suffering, InVoluntaryness. 

the MORE Presence and Probability there is of Any of these 5x Phenomena, 
the MORE Dystopian it is. 

the Presence and Probability of Violence is Number 1 Worst. 
the Presence and Probability of MindHarm is Number 2 Worst. 
the Presence and Probability of Evil is Number 3 Worst. 
the Presence and Probability of Involuntaryness is Number 4 Worst. 
the Presence and Probability of InVoluntary Suffering is Number 5 Worst. 



DYSTOPIA = DYSTOPIA is a SITUATION where there is Above Zero Presence of Any of the Following Phenomena →  Violence, MindHarm, Evil, Suffering, InVoluntaryness. 

the More there is of Violence, the More there is a Dystopian Situation. 
the Goal Priority is to make our Reality Situation to be as Least Dystopian as is possible.
